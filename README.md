# Optimization_Algorithms_Implementation
For the first problem, I implemented two functions to find the global minimum in 1D and 2D convex functions based on the gradient descent method and analyse them for different hyperparameters. For the second problem, I solved a constraint satisfaction problem using the AC-3 algorithm with the MRV utilization. For the last problem, I implemented a minimax player to play a game and analyse its function for playing with other minimax players or naive players.
